# InferSent Replication
---------------------------------------
In this folder I do a partial replication of the InferSent embeddings by Conneau et al. (2017). I create create sentence embeddings through training a Natural Language Inference Tasl. Specifically I train and evaluate four models:
* `base` : a base model which takes the mean of the GloVe embeddings of the sentence tokens as its representations.
* `lstm` takes a unidirectional LSTM as its sentence encoder.
* `bilstm` takes a bidirectional LSTM as its sentence encoder.
* `bilstmpool` has a bidirectional LSTM that applies max pooling over the hidden states of the tokens. 

The models are evaluated both on the NLI task and on a variety of SentEval tasks. I replicate the finding by Conneau et al. that the best results are obtained for the `bilstmpool` model. 

This project was carried out for the course Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics at the University of Amsterdam, taught by Ekaterina Shutova, Alina Leidinger and Rochelle Choenni.

The checkpoints of the models I trained and the tensorboard files can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18EWKTYv4CsF8mxgE7K4Ym6zHtqR6w6fF?usp=sharing).
